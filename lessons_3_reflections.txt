When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-when i run out of space locally 
-when working on a secret project
-when working on the go

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git autmatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-when different people are working on different branches where ideas are different so people wont want to keep the other branches with themselves locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
--forks
-used to copy a repository to our github account
--clones
-used to store the repository remotely
--branches
-used to create different ideas 
-used for different collaborators

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally can be beneficial because developing further on the project will be easier

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-without using github i can share my work using dropbox and other stuff like that; easier- automatic syncing of files through the desktop versions of dropbox and google drive, no need to push or pull 
-; harder- merging projects, versions cannot be controlled manually which leads to a lot of versions stored, versions lost after a certain time

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
--different branches
-when you want to create different versions of the same programme
-when you are not sure about a certain feature.
--master
-chaos of so many branches can be avoided
