When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-when i run out of space locally 
-when working on a secret project
-when working on the go

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git autmatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-when different people are working on different branches where ideas are different so people wont want to keep the other branches with themselves locally.
