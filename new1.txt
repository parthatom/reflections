Reflections Udacity GIT Lesson 1:

How did viewing the diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
- Viewing the diff helps spot any typos that may have occured while editing the code.
- it may help in telling us that the newer or older logic used might be wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- helps in viewing the diff between various versions to spot bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-pros:
--you can stop your log from cluttering
-cons:
--human error is inevitable
--requires practice to get used to the system

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-Git usually stores files that are interelated
-whereas Google docs stores documents that arent usually related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-git log shows the various commits that we have made
-git diff shows the difference between those commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-i am free to make changes that could break something because i can always use git checkout to go to previous version of my code
